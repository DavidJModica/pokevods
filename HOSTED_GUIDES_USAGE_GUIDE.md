### Step 4: Add Sections

The editor starts with one Introduction section. You can:

#### Add More Sections

- Choose the section type:
  - **Introduction** - Overview of the deck/guide

### Step 5: Save or Publish

- **Save Draft**: Saves your work without making it public
  - You can continue editing later
  - Only visible to you in the admin panel

- **Publish**: Makes the guide live and visible to all users

2. Find your guide in the list
3. Click **"Edit"** - opens the editor in a new tab

    Unpublish
```

- Guides start as **drafts** when created
- **Publishing** makes them visible to everyone
- You can **unpublish** to take them offline temporarily
- **Drafts** can still be edited and improved

## Viewing Published Guides

### As an Admin

You have two options:
1. **From Hosted Guides tab**: Click "View" on any published guide
